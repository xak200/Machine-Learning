The MNIST dataset is a database of handwritten digits. 
This problem set will apply SVMs to automatically classify digits; the US postal service uses a similar optical character recognition (OCR) of zip codes to automatically route letters to their destination. 
For this problem, a subset of the original dataset was randomly chosen. 
Two data files: mnist train.txt, mnist test.txt were provided.
The training set contains 2000 digits, and the test set contains 1000 digits. 
Each line represents an image of size 28 × 28 by a vector of length 784, with each feature specifying a grayscale pixel value. 
The first column contains the labels of the digits, 0–9, the next 28 columns respesent the first row of the image, and so on.
